# Network-Design-for-Airport
The Airport Network Project simulates a secure network for Airport Authority, Flight Service, and Guests using VLANs, DHCP, inter-VLAN routing, and ACLs to control access. A VPN provides secure remote access, while an access point enables guest internet. This setup isolates departments and maintains controlled connectivity throughout the airport.
